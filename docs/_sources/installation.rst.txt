============
Installation
============


A simple ``pip install`` should work.

.. code:: none

    pip install featuregen

Ideally nothing should break, but its good to create a virtual env for the use.

You probably should! ``pyenv`` is your friend. Google it.


.. _compilation:

Compilation
============

There is presently no need to compile **featuregen**, as it's written entirely in python.

.. _dependson:

Depends On
============

.. code:: py
	
	numpy 
	scipy
	pandas
    scikit-learn

Eventually would drop dependency on scikit learn.

A quick start would come soon.
