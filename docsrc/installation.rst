Installation
============


A simple ``pip install`` should work.

.. code:: none

    pip install pip install git+https://github.com/jkapila/featuregen.git

Ideally nothing should break, but its good to create a virtual env or ``pyenv``.

This is currently very much work in progress and is likely to change a lottt, over period of time.
